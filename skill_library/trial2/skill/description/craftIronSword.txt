async function craftIronSword(bot) {
    // The function crafts an iron sword using 2 iron ingots and 1 stick. If there are not enough iron ingots, it mines iron ores and smelts them into ingots. If there are not enough sticks, it crafts them. It then looks for a crafting table within 32 blocks, and if it doesn't find one, it places one nearby. Finally, it crafts an iron sword and logs a message.
