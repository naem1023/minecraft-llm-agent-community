async function craftIronHelmet(bot) {
    // The function crafts an iron helmet using iron ingots and a crafting table. It first checks if there are enough iron ingots in the inventory, and if not, it mines iron ores, places a furnace, and smelts the ores into ingots. Then it places a crafting table near the player and crafts an iron helmet using the ingots and the crafting table. Finally, it sends a chat message indicating that the iron helmet has been crafted.
